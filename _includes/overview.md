This is the course website for the "weird ways your mind works" class for [MIT ESP's Cascade program](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Cascade/index.html) in Fall 2015.  The class covers a collection of interesting and possibly unexpected features of how your mind works, with a focus on real-life demonstrations.

Each week after class, a page will be posted (in the sidebar on the left) with a summary and reference materials for what we covered.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to <a href="mailto: akenney@alum.mit.edu">email me</a>.
