Lecture notes


Attention / perception
* you notice what you're paying attention to and not other things ("spotlight")
  - demo (ish): you can switch focus back and forth
  - demo: multiple object tracking (multitasking is hard!)
  - example: cocktail party effect
      + hard but possible if hearing two things from same voice through both ears
      + pretty easy if through different ears
      + demo: (verbal shadowing) some things can draw your attention (e.g. your name, maybe)
      + don't notice things about unattended stimulus, e.g. content/language/backwards
  - demo: gorilla/basketball video
  - demo: card trick video
  - example: change blindness: "person-swapping" video
* attentional blink
* repetition blindness
  - demo: you're less likely to remember second occurrence of same word/item in a sequence
* subliminal perception / priming
  - example: popcorn/Coke messages in movie theatres (probably made up though)
  - example: subliminal priming with positive/negative image affects opinions of subsequent image
* blindsight, hemisphere neglect


Vision / perception
* context affects your interpretation of the same stimulus
  - example: high-level: Necker cube; B vs 13; summoning a lemon
  - demo: low-level: pink/orange rings
* your brain automatically adjusts for perspective/angle/lighting/etc
  - demo: checkerboard shadow, Rubik's cube colors, etc
  - demo: railroad tracks perspective
* a lot of things you "see" are actually your brain filling in probable information
  - example: you can't see during saccades
* one aspect of a stimulus can affect your perception of other aspects
  - demo: Stroop task
  - example: line seems longer if it takes more time to get that way
* visual search / pop-out
  - demo: conjunction search
* features are perceived separately and combined (illusory conjunction)
  - example: words and italics


Learning / memory
* conditioning
  + classical (Pavlovian) conditioning: associate stimulus with result
    - demo: shapes and sounds
    - example: Little Albert
    - example: advertising
  + operant conditioning: associate consequence with action
    - example: acquired food aversion
    - example: learning to obey parents
  + some things can be associated more easily than others
    - example: rats can associate taste with nausea and light/sound with shock but not vice-versa
* flashbulb memories
* false memories
  - example: Bugs Bunny at Disneyland
  - demo: listen to list of words, recall word that wasn't in the list ("sweet")
* encoding
  - chunks, 7 +/- 2
  - example: chessmasters are better at remembering chess boards, but *worse* at unrealistic ones
* the more you process something, the better you remember it
  - example: decide whether word is capitalized / fits in sentence
  - demo: spaced vs massed repetition
* you remember things better in context that you learned them
  - demo: memorizing and recalling word list in same or different location
  - example: memorizing and recalling word lists under water
* implicit versus explicit
  - demo: which direction is Mona Lisa facing
  - example: shaking hands with amnesia patient
* why do we forget things?
  - people who remember everything


Language / mental representation
* phonemes are categorical
* combining multiple input sources
  - demo: McGurk effect
* word segmentation is not obvious
  - example: "where are the silences between words?"
  - example: babies learning from conditional probabilities
* word learning
  - example: co-occurrence probabilities
  - demo: pragmatics/informativeness
* different words contain different amounts of information, context is important
  - demo: "little" out of context
  - demo: how many guesses to guess the next letter
* mental representations of language
  - demo: semantic priming: [TODO]
  - demo: syntactic priming: [TODO]
* categories
  - demo: category levels: is this a tufa?
  - demo: prototypes: draw a chair, show me a color
  - demo: asymmetric similarity: how much is a chicken like a sparrow vs a sparrow like a chicken?
  - you can recognize things from different positions, angles, occlusions, etc
      (cf 9.00 lecture 5 slide 11)


Decision-making / logic
* framing
  - demo: "none will be saved" vs "all will die"
* people have bad intuition for some kinds of probability
  - demo: which is more likely, HHHHH or HTHHT?
  - demo: base rate neglect
  - demo: birthday problem
* availability heuristic
  - example: likelihood of dying from a terrorist attack versus drowning in a bathtub
  - demo: does L occur more often as first letter or third letter of a word?
  - example: quiz show study
* anchoring
  - example (from Dan Ariely): Tom Sawyer
  - example: $5 difference in cost for $2 pen vs $200 suit
  - example: "foot-in-the-door" technique
  - demo: write down the last two digits of your SSN, would you pay more or less for item?  how much?
* confirmation bias (in hypothesis testing, interpreting, and remembering)
  - example: people judge studies that support their opinions to be better-conducted
  - demo: Wason card task
* opinions/behaviors depend on expectations
  - example: vinegar in beer
  - example: stereotype threat: write down ethnicity/gender before taking test
  - example: self-fulfilling prophecy: blue-eyed vs brown-eyed scarves
  - example: self-fulfilling prophecy: people perceived as attractive behave more attractively
* cognitive dissonance
  - example: place value on sports tickets you did or didn't get
  - demo: do a boring task for a reward or for free, rate its enjoyability
* you like things better that are more familiar
  - example: friendships are largely based on who you happen to be around
  - example: writing about a belief makes you believe it more strongly
  - demo: random characters


Social / morality
* emotions are relative
  - example: people who win the lottery / become paraplegic
* physical state affects emotional state
  - example: pencil in mouth
  - example: heartbeat sound while judging attractiveness
* behavior is very context-dependent and different from what you think you would do
  - example: social desirability bias
  - example: good Samaritan effect
  - example: bystander effect
  - example: Asch conformity study, broken window theory
  - example: Milgram and obedience
  - example: Stanford Prison Experiment
* perception of people
  + ingroup is heterogeneous and other people are all the same
  + my behavior is based on circumstances but other people's is based on personality
  - example: halo effect: people wearing "fake" sunglasses cheat more
  - demo: halo effect
* internal versus external motivation
  - example: rewarding kids for drawing pictures
  - example: praise for behavior versus for personality
* social interaction/roles
  - example: rats and cocaine versus playground
  - example: learned helplessness
* morality
  - demo: punishment based on outcome rather than intention
  - demo: trolley problem
  - demo: ultimatum game
